# Introduction or why the hell I write a blog

Hi there! This is one more useless blog with articles about my random thoughts. However, I hope my articles will not be random.

So why do I write a blog? Well, I want to further develop my skills with the help of it. Here they are:

* express my thoughts more clearly;
* learn how to structure my thoughts;
* get some experience in writing; and
* practice my English.

Why do I need them? I am a software engineer in an international company. During my professional development I realized that the most valuable skill is the ability to express your technical opinion clearly in verbal or written form to any person regardless background. It is hard to do! It is especially difficult when English is not your mother tongue.

Well, we'll see how my blog helps in my endeavor.
