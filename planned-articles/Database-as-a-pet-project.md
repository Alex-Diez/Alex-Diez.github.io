# Database as a pet project

Pet projects one of the way how software developers can improve their skills, learn things and get to know new technical areas. In this article I want to look at props and cons of writing your own database as a pet project.

I start with props and here is the list:

* It is hard subject, so it is interesting;
* Almost all applications use database, so it helps you understand how real databases work. What they can or can't and why;
* Databases use tricked and complicated algorithms with which you get acquainted; and
* Database is a client-server application, so you learn network protocols and/or develop your own.

Here are cons:

* It is hard subject, so you can lose interest;
* It is not so popular subject as Web and Big Data which dominate on the market; and
* There are other cons that I don't consider because I don't see them.

However, the most motivated factor for me is that you may control the complexity of your pet project. You may write a simple single-threaded or a highly concurrent multithreaded application. You may write an easy to test in-memory database or a hard to test database with persistency. You may use networking and data structures libraries which you would not consider to use on your work project. You, even, may implement distributed database system.

Databases are a very broad subject and it is a good exercise to sharp you software engineering skills.
