title: About me
---

**My name is Alex. I am a software developer.**

I prefer to work on critical parts of software systems and take responsibility for the full development cycle of products.

I apply engineering practices such as test-driven development, continues integration and continues deployment to build a product that end-users like. That is what helps me in delivering quality software written in Java, Elixir, Ruby, Python and JavaScript.

My mission is to build teams that develop products that users love. That is why I implement and deliver workshop and training on test-driven development for the company engineers.

I sharp my programming skills by constantly doing [coding exercises in different languages](https://github.com/alex-dukhno?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=tdd-katas&type=&language=).
