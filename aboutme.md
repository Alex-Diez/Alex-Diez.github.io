**My name is Alex. I am a software developer.**

My mission is to build teams that develop products that users love. To accomplish it:

 * I share my experience with the company engineers by delivering training on test-driven development.
 * I work with the team on critical parts of software systems taking responsibility for the full development life cycle.
 * I promote engineering practices such as test-driven development, continuous integration and continuous deployment in my team and company.
 * I assist the team in delivering quality software written in Java, Elixir, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.
 * I sharp my programming skills by constantly doing [coding exercises in different languages](https://github.com/alex-dukhno?utf8=âœ“&tab=repositories&q=tdd-katas&type=&language=).
