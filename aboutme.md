title: About me

**My name is Alex. I am a software developer.**

I prefer to work on critical parts of software systems. I worked on computation pipeline and infrastructure code for distributed on-premise performance system. I also developed a service that handles 250K end-users requests. I am excited to take responsibility and accountability of a full development cycle for a product - from an idea to a finished product.

I apply engineering practices such as test-driven development, continues integration and continues deployment to build a product that end-users like. This environment helps me quickly dive into new projects and technologies.

I have commercial experience of working with Java, Elixir, Ruby, Python and JavaScript programming languages.

Also, I implement and deliver workshop and training on test-driven development for company engineers. Constantly mentor my teammates to be better engineers.

My mission is to build teams that develop products that users love.

My interests are concurrency and distributed systems, functional programming, system programming, and operating systems and hardware design.
