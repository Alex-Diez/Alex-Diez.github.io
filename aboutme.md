My name is Alex. I am a software engineer with passion to designing and developing software that brings value to the end users.

Most of my career I built commercial software in Java. However, I have experience of delivering products written in Ruby, JavaScript and Python.

I am interested in concurrency & distributed systems, functional programming, system programming & operating systems and hardware design.
